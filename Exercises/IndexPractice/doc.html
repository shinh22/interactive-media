			I like simple things. <br>
			I feel catharsis when a minimal design explains the maximum. <br>
			In this last project, I tried to align my works in the minimum elements.
		</p>

		<p>
			One of the best web designs I think is Apple’s product page. They communicate with their customers within a very effective and clear form. They might use some splendid colours and videos on the page; however, I’m not talking about the contents. What I’d like to focus more on is the frame with no unnecessary aspects.
		<br>
		<br>
			The structure is very simple, but there are various intriguing details in it. Most of their pictures are sequence images or videos, and those are visualized with animations. I respect this way to present, so I’d try similar methods.

		<p>
			I want to draw people’s curiosity. I want to surprise them (not that much!) like a little present box. I want to provide visitors with an experience animated by my webpage. From that point, I made a list of verbs that perhaps make people excited: unwrap, untie, unbutton, discover, peekaboo, open, turn over, hatch, unlock, stick out, pull…

		<div class="abox">

			I mapped out a color palette. I wanted to use many colors but not very vivid ones -- something neutral yet joyful. Instead of picking specific colors, I set the saturation and hue (Saturation 30%, Hue 66%) so that I can use diverse colors in a similar tone.

<!-- Section: Process -->
		<h2>PROCESS</h2>
		<img src="img/capture2.png">
		<p>
			I initially started working on the Readings section. I was planning on placing the readings into iframe, but I thought it is kind of unnecessary. Rather, I put them on a full-sized screen and made them parallelly connected. I added small buttons for navigation.
		</p>
		<img src="img/capture3.png">
		<p>
			One problem with this section was that the text is quite a lot for small screens. I had to figure out how to put them on a single page with a fixed size. I set different text-box sizes depending on the width of the screen and made the text-boxes have a scroll in them to contain more contents than their size.
		</p>
		<img src="img/capture4.png">
		<p>
			What’s good about this presentation is that it does not show the next contents on the same page, so I think users would feel interested when they go into the unknown. The sliding (or swapping) animation and background gradation helps the joy of moving to other pages.
		</p>
		<img src="img/capture5.png">
		<p>
			Then I worked on the Exercises section. Similar to the Readings section, I wanted to keep the contents secret. I covered black matte on the grid where all exercises are in. Then, when the mouse cursor is on it, it reveals the number of exercises. At first, I made them become white when hovered, but I found that is less interesting. So I put different colors in the same tone. The numbers are quite huge and thick to present better visibility. 
		</p>
		<img src="img/capture6.png">
		<p>
			While coding the Exercises section, I came up with an idea to flip vertically to show the contents and started to work on the Projects section. At first, I was creating a grid to align the items, but it seemed like repeating the Exercise section. So I decided to make use of the letters ‘PROJECTS’. I designed it also hides its contents and users can check it when it has hovered. I used similar colors in other sections.

		 AOS: Animate On Scroll Library </a>
		</div>
		<p>
			Inspired by Apple’s web page, I applied a scroll library to present animations depending on how much the scroll has moved. There are many libraries available, but I used AOS (Animate On Scroll) library, which is very easy to work with. I applied the effect to all sections.
		</p>
		<img src="img/capture8.png">
		<p>
			After I finished most of the index page, I found something is missing. Although I intended the minimal layout, it seemed that the page is still visually not appealing. So I added some tropical leaves with scroll animation so that visitors can have a kind of adventuring or discovering experience when they clearing way the leaves and access to the contents.
