					<h2>How to Crit</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="exbox">
					<p>
						<span class="bold">What are some challenges you face when giving a critique? </span>
						<br>
						I’m a bit worried if I could give him/her a kind of negative feeling. This is primarily because I personally don’t enjoy talking about negative impressions about the result of other’s hard work. Rather than thinking that I could help their work improved, I feel like I’m insulting them. Although I know giving a critique is an important process of synthesis, I just feel so. For example, I have a bad experience that I had to give negative feedback to my peer. When I worked at an exhibition producing company, I had a lot of meetings to plan a Korean calligraphy exhibition. I worked with a female calligrapher, and we had some conflicts while planning her exhibition. She was disappointed every time when I give her some negative reaction, so I had to be really careful not to lose her motivation. Because of similar experiences like this, I feel uncomfortable when I give a negative critique to others.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?</span>
						<br>
						I try to objectify myself. To begin with, I embrace what I feel. It sometimes hurts me, of course, but those negative feelings don’t naturally disappear. I admit the feeling first, and then try to take it easy. Without an emotional impression, it’s easier to take the critique that I found hard to agree with. When I treat myself as a third person, I can exclude a tendency myself that I want to see only positive feedback. However, to improve myself continuously, it is important to accept both positive and negative critiques. For example, when you face a pessimistic opinion about your work, you might want to avoid taking it or feel lowered self-esteem. However, if you keep not trying to take any negative opinion, you can’t escape from every similar situation forever. You sometimes have to push and train yourself so that you can be a better person and make you work even better.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques?</span>
						<br>
						Exchanging critique is very important in that the process helps us improved. I trust in Hegel’s dialectic theory. When an issue is raised, there should be any positive or negative opinion. By reinforcing the good ones and making up for bad ones, we can access a better conclusion or solution to the current issue. To refer to Hegel’s dialectic, the process of development consists of three-phase: thesis-antithesis-synthesis. 
						<br>
						Also, critique helps us to take diverse perspectives. What’s good about having different opinions is that we can solder our logical cracks which we cannot catch ourselves. We often fall into a trap of arrogance that we understand everything and don’t miss anything. Either our thought is ideal or not, taking a critique is very helpful in that we can proofread our idea or supplement what we need more.

					<h2>What Screens Want</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="exbox">
					<p>
						<span class="bold">1. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other. </span>
						<br>
						Although both skeuomorphism and flat design are essential and valuable, I would say flat design works better if I have to choose only one of them. Among many reasons, I would like to talk about the efficiency of user recognition in this discussion. 
						<br>
						Yes, I think flat design has better user recognition. Others might say that skeuomorphism is better because it is more similar to ‘real things’, so users would feel more familiar with it and therefore feel easier to take the information on the screen. However, when it comes to a matter of interface where users would meet every day, it gets bloated. To be specific, everything on the screen expresses heavy attention, which means that it becomes hard to distinguish the focus point from less important aspects. Users have to glare their eyes to find what they want to access. In other words, a screen with skeuomorphism is already full of information. Think of a book consisting of every single text with a three-dimensional aspect, like the shadow, or a comic book with only real pictures. It is not fun, but most importantly, not easily readable.
						<br>
						On the other hand, flat design exploits the most straightforward but most powerful medium to deliver information to users: symbols. It is a social and implicit promise that represents a sign or meaning in the most compressive forms. Of course, it necessitates some time or education for users to understand and internalize a symbol. However, once they get used to the substructure, they do not have to use their time to comprehend it, just like what text or traffic signs offer.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">2. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</span>
						<br>
						Zoopraxiscope, named by Muybridge, is a continuative series of pictures taken at intervals of a brief time. The pictures were printed on a spinning glass disc and projected one by one to show a moving picture. The author of the article argues that web and interaction design succeed filmmaking in that zoopraxiscope has led to the advent of screens. Also, he connects web and interaction design by saying that they do not belong to the realm of aesthetics but to other aspects such as time, movement, and change. 
						<br>
						Likewise, filmmaking has impacted the development of the digital design. In addition to the case of the screen’s advent from zoopraxiscope, the form and shape of the screen have also been affected by filmmaking. For example, the filmmaking industry has been trying to create livelier movie experiences. As one of the efforts, they made 3d glasses for the more realistic movies, and now they have reached to VR or AR stage. Unlike conventional screens, now the screens have the z-axis in which users can interact with more information and contents on the same single screen. Now users can access literally to ‘behind the scene’. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">3. Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.</span>
						<br>
						Frank emphasizes the usefulness of flux by stating that “it encompasses many of the things we take for granted in the digital realm”. I agree with his idea in terms of adaptability and economy. In my understanding, what’s good about flux is that it assigns adaptability to screens so that they can adjust themselves to its circumstance. What I mean by the term ‘circumstance’ includes the shape of screens, the time they are used, or the person who uses them. Flux does not only guarantee efficiency but also provides a broader and more extended range of digital content. Accordingly, users will have a better and more diverse experience even with the same contents. 
						<br>
						Also, a more efficient method is naturally related to a better economic condition. In digital design or web, flux reduces the maintenance costs. Once a system is set up, there are not so many things to do to maintain it. For example, if a website consists of responsive content, the developer does not have to make different compositions of the contents for different formats of screens. It saves lots of time and effort. Similarly, if there is no flux, users might have to purchase several devices that are optimized to different web formats or purposes.

					<h2>Touring Complete User</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="exbox">
					<p>
						<span class="bold">1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? </span>
						<br>
						Lialina explains her idea about the term ‘user’ by comparing it with the conventional meaning of ‘user’ used in the digital industry, which had been used to refer to both ‘people’ and ‘developers’. She draws a line between people and developers on the basis of the relationship between computers and them. To be specific, if a subject uses ‘computer’ to get involved in the system, then they should be called ‘users’; on the other hand, if the subject uses ‘system’ itself, they should be regarded as ‘people’ (I’d say, consumers). 
						<br>
						She justifies her definition for several reasons; first, programmers or developers had already used the term ‘user’ to name themselves and took it for granted before others referred the term to indicate ‘those who pay money to use the system’ or both ‘people and developers’ (or even before the existence of computer). Also, what’s good about appointing her definition of ‘user’ is that it can protect users’ rights (claimed <a href="https://userrights.contemporary-home-computing.org/">👉HERE</a>). 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</span>
						<br>
						Lialina argues that the ideal internet user is ‘the general user’ (also called ‘Universal User’ and ‘Turing Complete User’). This idea comes from Alan Truing’s Universal Turing Machine, which refers to computers. Namely, as the tool (computer) is not limited to performing a specialized function but does universal roles, the user also needs to be actively engaged to make use of the tool’s full potential. 
						<br>
						Good ‘General Purpose Users’ will take all advantage of computers. They will utilize both the primary or supplementary usefulness of any programs or functions of computers in order to materialize what they want to do. She also gives a Universal User’s mindset. According to her, a Universal User understands well both hardware and software. These qualities enable users to access their goals with diverse methods. So to speak, there is no given way to go;  only exploration exists.
						<br>
						At the same time, she points out that there are ‘gaps that can be filled by users’ to illustrate the cooperation among users. Users will make harmony and create the thesis-antithesis-synthesis process one another to cover up flaws in a system or web in which they interact together.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</span>
						<br>
						There are plenty of interactions on the web where gaps are filled by users. For example, Wikipedia is one of them; users spontaneously take part in explaining new emerging notions or editing changed information in preexisting knowledge. If any errors or missing points are recognized, any user can make up for the defects. Now Wikipedia is one of the largest archives where an uncountable amount of data is being stacked up.
						<br>
						We can also think of Github, which we enjoy as the course material. In Github, any user can upload digital codes and use the website as web storage. At the same time, users can exchange various feedbacks so that your programming can be complete and more efficient.
						<br>
						What about restaurant review sites? It has become very natural to visit a restaurant after having full information about there thanks to other users’ reviews. After the dining, you will also share your experience on the same website while going back home.

						<span class="bold">1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</span>
						<br>
						Laurel highlights that individuals should have their own web pages instead of ones ruled by huge social media companies. Although it is true that social media is a very potent tool to create and manage our personal pages, it also takes opportunities for creative attempts from people, especially from artists. She argues that websites lose their vitality when used as just display cupboards, just like what is offered by social media services nowadays. I also believe it is better to have my own webpage than use social media services. 
						<br>
						I’m not trying to say that social media services are unnecessary. I admit the fortes of the services: they have a colossal user pool, they are efficient, etc. At the same time, they make us lazy. I mean, they make us tamed so that we cannot create any fruit on our own. It manipulates our taste and makes it dull, so the more we use them, the more difficult to leave them. We should remind that the most dangerous threat is familiarity. I believe that creative activities free from any formats or restrictions bring real innovation and change the world.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website.

					<h2>the Poetry of Tools</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="exbox">
						<p>
							<span class="bold">1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</span>
							<br>
							I think what Seu wants us to do by using the phrase ‘defamiliarize our tools’ is that think about the tools around us in an unconventional way. We tend to think that every tool has very specific goals that give the reasons for its existence.  In other words, we connect the worth of a tool with its productivity and value it depending on its usefulness. 
							<br>
							However, when we take a step back a little from the basis, we can fully enjoy the beauty of the tools. For example, Seu states that ‘technology is a form of language’. When it comes to language, its primary purpose is delivering linguistic information from one to another. On the other hand, there is also a very beautiful artistic aspect of language:  referring to Seu’s expression, poetry.  In terms of efficiency or productivity, poetry has a relatively mere worth compared to other aspects of language.  Nevertheless, I think that’s not all of it. If we regard language only as a tool for data delivery, we will never see another side of its beauty. Therefore, when we try to treat technology in an unfamiliar way, I believe that we will be able to comprehend its full potential.
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="bold">2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</span>
							<br>
							I would like to call ‘Removing Function from Form’ (RFF) as Pretty Rubbish. I am not saying those works are something like trash, but in the industrial design field in South Korea, beautiful goods with no (or less) function are often regarded as it. As Seu explains, RFF literally means the extraction of the aesthetic facet from digital tools, rather than focusing on their purposes. In my perspective, Seu’s explanation of RFF corresponds with the notion of Pretty Rubbish in that their aesthetic factor is more important than the functional factor in this area.
							<br>
							Here is an example (<a href="https://textart.sh">👉https://textart.sh</a>) to illustrate the feature of RFF or Pretty Rubbish. The web page shows a list of random text art. Text art, also known as ASCII art, is an art performance with images drawn by only using text components (used to using ASCII compliant characters, but it has been developed a lot). It utilizes different densities or thicknesses of the characters to present various textures or directions of lines. Diverse characters are united and make an image as a whole. The characters do not have any linguistic meaning. However, our to-do is just enjoying the pulchritude how they are related to one another and create harmony as an organic body.
