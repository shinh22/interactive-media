                There are tons of useful tools that help us to visualize what we have in our mind. As an industrial design student, we learn about diverse 3D softwares like Rhinoceros, Fusion 360, etc. If the tools are useful enough to actualize our design, then why do we learn drawing in the very first year of the course? The answer is simple; it is just because drawing is the most fundamental practice in the design process. Continuous and monotonous disciplines of drawing will build a habitual observation. By extension, a good design (or inspiration) comes from keen observation. Thatâ€™s what every professor I have met has taught me, and I have never doubted the importance of basics.

                I think a (personal) website is the same. There is an uncountable number of template-like services where we can create a webpage with a few clicks. On the other hand, for designers (or design students), I believe we will certainly have better ones after efforts and errors. It might be a boring way to go, or you might lose the will because of many difficulties. However, what I can be sure of is that the practice and enjoying it will eventually grant us more creativity and skills so that we can produce various fruits from it.
